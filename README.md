# SQL-Insights-to-Scale-a-Music-Store-Worldwide
Analyzed music store data using SQL to uncover profitable markets, customer segments, and genres. Converted insights into actionable strategies, enabling leadership to invest in high-growth areas and enhance customer value.


I was hired as a Data Analyst by a global Music Store to uncover where the business is winning (markets, customers, genres, artists) and how to scale growth. 

When I joined the Music Store team as a Data Analyst, the leadership was struggling to make informed decisions. Sales were happening across different countries, customers were purchasing different genres, and artists were earning unevenly - but no one knew where the real business opportunities were.

Data was fragmented across multiple tables, and teams relied on guesswork instead of insights.

To fix this, I conducted a full SQL-based analysis to:

( 1 ) Identify the most profitable markets & customers

( 2 ) Understand purchase behavior across genres and countries

( 3 ) Help the business plan high-ROI events, loyalty programs, and targeted campaigns

I analyzed our relational database with SQL and converted results into clear business actions

This project transformed raw, scattered data into clear, actionable strategies — empowering leadership to invest in the right markets, promote the right artists, and enhance customer value
